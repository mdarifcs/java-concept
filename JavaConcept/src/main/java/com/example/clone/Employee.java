/**
 * @author mohammad.arif
 * So deep cloning requires satisfaction of following rules â€“
 * 1. No need to separately copy primitives.
 * 2. All the member classes in original class should support cloning(i.e. implement cloneable interface)
 * and in clone method of original class in context should call super.clone() on all member classes.
 * 3. If any member class does not support cloning then in clone method, one must create a new instance
 * of that member class and copy all its attributes one by one to new member class object.
 * This new member class object will be set in cloned object.
